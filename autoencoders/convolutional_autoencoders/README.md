# Convolutional Autoencoders

In this notebook we will:
- Look at a **recap** of **ordinary autoencoders**
- Understand the structure of **convolutional autoencoders** (CAEs)
- Understand why CAEs are **uniquely appropriate** for dimensionality reduction in image data
- Learn how to **build/train a CAE**, utilizing the MNIST dataset in the process
- Explore how our decoder behaves as we **travel through the latent space**
- **Directly observe latent space encodings** of similar and distinct digits
- Build a CAE for **noise reduction**
- Build a CNN for **MNIST classification**
- Explore whether or not using a CAE as a **denoising preprocessing step** for a classification CNN is worthwhile
