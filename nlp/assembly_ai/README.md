# Video Review Sentiment Analysis

A mini-project on performing automated sentiment analysis for product video reviews by using [**AssemblyAI's**](https://www.assemblyai.com/) audio transcription API and a pretrained BERT model.

Follow along with the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/oconnoob/ML_Projects/blob/main/nlp/assembly_ai/BERT%20Reviews.ipynb) here. The corresponding page on my website can be found [here](https://www.ryansoconnor.com/video-review-sentiment-analysis).


### In this notebook we:
- Learn about **AssemblyAI's Speech-to-Text API** and create a free account
- Use **URL requests** and **FFmpeg** to automatically download audio from iPhone 10 reviews on YouTube
- **Use AssemblyAI's API** to upload these audio files and receive **transcripts of the reviews**
- Learn about the **BERT model**
- Utilize **Hugging Face's model repo** to download a **pretrained BERT model**
- Use this BERT model to perform **review classification** to **determine public opinion on the iPhone 10**
